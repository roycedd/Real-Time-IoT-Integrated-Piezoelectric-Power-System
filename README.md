# Real-Time-IoT-Integrated-Piezoelectric-Power-System

A smart energy harvesting system that captures mechanical vibrations using piezoelectric transducers and sends real-time voltage, current, and power data to the cloud via **ESP32** and **Firebase**.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project presents an **IoT-enabled piezoelectric energy harvesting system** that converts mechanical pressure/vibrations into electrical energy, while also providing real-time performance monitoring via the cloud.


## 🔧 Problem Statement

Traditional piezoelectric systems lack visibility and diagnostic tools. This project overcomes those limitations by introducing:

- 📈 Real-time monitoring of voltage, current, and power.
- 🔍 Fault detection of piezoelectric elements via force sensors.
- ☁️ Live data streaming to Firebase Realtime Database.
- 📱 Mobile or Web dashboard integration for visualization.

## 🧠 Objectives

- Convert mechanical vibrations to electrical energy using **piezoelectric transducers**.
- Measure electrical parameters using **INA3221** sensor.
- Use **ESP32** for data acquisition and Wi-Fi-based cloud communication.
- Push data to **Firebase** for storage and remote access.
- Detect faulty transducers using **force sensors**.
- Provide live performance metrics on web/mobile dashboards.

## 🔁 System Workflow

Vibrations → Piezoelectric Transducer → Rectifier → INA3221 Sensor → ESP32 Microcontroller → Wi-Fi → Firebase RTDB → Web Dashboard

## 💻 Code Snippet

```cpp
float voltage_mv[3], current_ma[3], power_mw[3];
voltage_mv[i] = ina3221.getBusVoltage(i + 1) * 1000.0;
current_ma[i] = ina3221.getCurrentAmps(i + 1) * 1000.0;
power_mw[i]   = (voltage_mv[i] * current_ma[i]) / 1000.0;
Firebase.RTDB.setFloat(&fbdo, "/Channel1/History/timestamp/Voltage", voltage_mv[0]);
